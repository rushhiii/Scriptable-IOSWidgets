# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## 🚀 Quick Setup for GitHub Pages Deployment

After pushing the updated workflow, you need to configure GitHub Pages in your repository settings:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/rushhiii/Scriptable-IOSWidgets`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Click on **Pages**

### Step 2: Configure Pages Source

1. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (not Deploy from a branch)
2. This tells GitHub to use the workflow we created instead of looking for a gh-pages branch

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. Push your changes to the main branch
2. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
3. Watch the "Deploy VitePress Documentation" workflow run
4. Once complete, your site will be available at: `https://rushhiii.github.io/Scriptable-IOSWidgets/`

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Previous Issues:
- ❌ Missing permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN
- ❌ Using deprecated peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
- ❌ No proper environment configuration
- ❌ **MAJOR**: Base path configuration causing styling issues on GitHub Pages

### Solutions Applied:
- ✅ Added proper permissions (`contents: read`, `pages: write`, `id-token: write`)
- ✅ Updated to use official GitHub Pages actions
- ✅ Added environment configuration for better security
- ✅ Using modern `actions/deploy-pages@v4`
- ✅ **FIXED**: Enabled base path `/Scriptable-IOSWidgets/` for proper asset loading
- ✅ Added configurable base path for local development vs production

## 📝 Updated Workflow Features

- **Automatic Deployment**: Deploys on every push to main branch
- **Security**: Uses GitHub's official Pages deployment actions
- **Reliability**: Modern actions with better error handling
- **URL Output**: Provides the deployed site URL after successful deployment

## 🌐 Expected Site URL

Your documentation will be available at:
```
https://rushhiii.github.io/Scriptable-IOSWidgets/
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If the deployment still fails:

1. **Check Repository Settings**: Ensure Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
2. **Verify Workflow**: Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
3. **Repository Permissions**: Make sure your account has admin access to the repository
4. **Branch Protection**: Ensure main branch allows Actions to run
5. **Styling Issues**: If the site appears unstyled, ensure base path is correctly set to `/Scriptable-IOSWidgets/`

## 🛠️ Local Development

For local development, use:
```bash
npm run docs:dev        # Standard dev server (with base path)
npm run docs:dev-local  # Local dev without base path for easier development
```

The workflow should now deploy successfully with proper styling! 🎉
