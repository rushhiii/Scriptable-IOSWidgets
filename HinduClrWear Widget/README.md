## 💡 Behind the Color Logic

Each day's color is defined by an array in the script like:

```js
{
  day: "Thursday",
  colorName: "Yellow",
  color: "#FFD700",
  reason: "Yellow signifies knowledge, learning, and positivity. Thursday, governed by Jupiter (Guru)..."
}
```
Feel free to customize this array for regional traditions or alternate meanings.
