- Summaries of every widget and the problem it solves.
- Step-by-step onboarding for Scriptable newcomers.

## Get Started in Minutes

1. Install Scriptable from the iOS App Store and grant necessary permissions (location, calendar, etc.).
2. Pick a widget from the library and read its guide end-to-end.
3. Copy the JavaScript file into Scriptable and add required configuration (API keys, parameters, or Google Sheets links).
4. Run the script inside Scriptable to validate network calls and formatting.
5. Add the widget to the home screen, set its parameter string, and verify refresh behavior.

## Why Teams Use These Widgets

- **Actively maintained**: scripts receive iterative updates as APIs or iOS behaviors change.
- **Well documented**: every widget page includes prerequisites, configuration tables, and troubleshooting sections.
- **Customizable**: colors, layouts, data sources, and refresh intervals are exposed via constants or parameters.
- **Efficient**: careful data fetching keeps battery impact low while still delivering live information.
