## Tips for Smooth Setup

> 🌟 **New to Scriptable?** Start with low-complexity widgets such as Quote or Birthday and build confidence before trying data-heavy scripts.

> 📖 **Always read the README** bundled with each widget inside the `Widgets/` directory—they include script-level notes and troubleshooting steps.

> ⚡ **Test first, add later**. Run the script directly in Scriptable to confirm data pulls and API keys before pinning it to the home screen.

> 🤝 **Ask the community**. Open a GitHub Discussion if you need help with parameters, theming, or API limits.
